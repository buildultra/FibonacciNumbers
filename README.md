# FibonacciNumbers

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers or Fibonacci sequence are the numbers in the following integer sequence: or: . By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 1 and 1, or 0 and 1, depending on the chosen starting point of the sequence, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. In mathematical terms, the sequence Fₙ of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation with seed values or The Fibonacci sequence is named after Fibonacci. His 1202 book Liber Abaci introduced the sequence to Western European mathematics, although the sequence had been described earlier in Indian mathematics. By modern convention, the sequence begins either with F₀ = 0 or with F₁ = 1. The Liber Abaci began the sequence with F₁ = 1. Fibonacci numbers are closely related to Lucas numbers in that they are a complementary pair of Lucas sequences. They are intimately connected with the golden ratio; for example, the closest rational approximations to the ratio are 2/1, 3/2, 5/3, 8/5, ... .
